            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Ethan and I'm currently a first year at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo.
                In my free time I enjoy listening to music, spending time with friends, taking pictures, editing videos, 
                and working on coding projects.
            </p>
            <p>I mostly code in Python and Javascript with proficiency in HTML and CSS.</p>

            <!--Yutnori-->
            <h2>
                Project: Yutnori
            </h2>
            <p>
                Yutnori is a traditional Korean board game similar to the board game "Sorry!" 
                and it's one of my favorites.
                I made a simplified text version of yutnori using Python 
                to share and play yutnori with my friends without a physical set.

            <!--Download Delete-->
            <h2>
                Project: Download Delete 
            </h2>
            <p>
                As a frequent user of my macbook, I often find my downloads folder very messy. 
                To solve that I created a Python command that identifies and deletes all the junk in my downloads 
                without deleting any important documents.
